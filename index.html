        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            I am a 19 year old college student majoring in computer science at Cerritos college.
            I grew up dreaming of working towards an artistic career, but I decided that I needed something stable.
            It was when I had the opportunity to learn with Girls Who Code that I fell in love with programming. 
            I like to think that coding itself is an art form and I want to be able to explore that side while I continue finding my place here.
            HTML is my favorite language so far because I love making websites and seeing the fruits of my labor in the front end. I'm also learning Python, Java, and CSS.
